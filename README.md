# Password Generator

Used to generate passwords based on user specifications.

## Description

This program is designed to generate complicated passwords. Users have control over the length of password, as well as if there will be special characters, uppercase/lowercase letters, and/or numbers. This is important as interfaces have different password requirements. There are checks in place to ensure that users enter the correct responses to prompts.
